      "reTyre is an innovative start-up company that made the first ever modular bicycle tyre, for which they received a few prestigious awards, including the Red Dot Design Award for highest design quality. Working with a company that aspires to be different and strives to set the trends allowed us to present their brand in a unique and creative way. Just like reTyre wants to improve user experience for their customers, our goal was to show how they can do this and what makes their products unique and necessary.",
    challenge:
      "Good web design lets the product speak for itself. We had to find a way to achieve this, explaining along the way what reTyre is and how their products work. It’s never easy to design a website for a new product. The challenge is greater because you have to find the perfect balance between a clean, user-friendly design and content-rich guides that explain the purpose of the innovative products.",
    approach:
      "Since we were dealing with creative and innovative tyre solutions, we found that the best way to approach the design is by letting the pictures and animations showcase the value of the products. The main idea was to allow visitors to find all the necessary information about the products thanks to the intuitive site navigation and create attractive visual experience that will make them stay long enough to truly understand the benefits of the products.",
    mobile:
      "A functional and clean mobile design is crucial for reaching all users and increasing the market for your products. Our websites are mobile-friendly and mobile responsive and allow our clients, like reTyre, to showcase their products or services on all devices.",

          "With new and creative products, it takes time for customers to accept them. Reading the product description may engage a few visitors but seeing how the product looks and what it does is a more effective way to present it. That’s why we have combined text and animations to showcase reTyre’s products, focusing on appearance and functionality.",
